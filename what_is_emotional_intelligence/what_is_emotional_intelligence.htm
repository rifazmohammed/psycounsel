<h2 class="main-heading">What Is Emotional Intelligence? </h2>
                        <p>Emotional intelligence represents an ability to validly reason with emotions and to use emotions to enhance thought </p>
                        <p>A more formal definition is... <br>
                        We define EI as the capacity to reason about emotions, and of emotions to enhance thinking. It includes the abilities to accurately perceive emotions, to access and generate emotions so as to assist thought, to understand emotions and emotional knowledge, and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to promote emotional and intellectual growth <br>
                        <br>
                        Here is another definition my colleagues and I have employed: <br>
                        <br>
                        Emotional intelligence refers to an ability to recognize the meanings of emotion and their relationships, and to reason and problem-solve on the basis of them. Emotional intelligence is involved in the capacity to perceive emotions, assimilate emotion-related feelings, understand the information of those emotions, and manage them. <br>
                        <br>
                        Emotion . In this model, emotion refers to a feeling state (including physiological responses and cognitions) that conveys information about relationships. For example, happiness is a feeling state that also conveys information about relationships -- typically, that one would like to join with others. Similarly, fear is a feeling state that corresponds to a relationship -- the urge to flee others. <br>
                        <br>
                        Intelligence . In this model, intelligence refers to the capacity to reason validly about information. </p>
                        <p>This use of the term emotional intelligence in this fashion is consistent with scientific literature in the fields of intelligence, personality psychology, and emotions [2]. <br>
                          <br>
                        For example: <br>
                        <br>
                        Verbal intelligence concerns the mental ability to reason with and about verbal information, and of verbal knowledge to enhance thought. </p>
                        <p>Spatial intelligence concerns the mental ability to reason with and about spatial information (i.e., the shape of objects and their orientation in space) and of spatial knowledge to enhance thought. </p>
                        <h2>Emotional Intelligence and Related Variables </h2>
                        <h3>Variables that Come to Mind in Relation to Emotional Intelligence </h3>
                        <p>Earlier, emotional intelligence was defined as the capacity to reason validly with emotional information, and of emotional information to enhance thought. </p>
                        <p>Many people also associate emotional intelligence with other personality characteristics. Indeed, when a person brings up the term, &quot;Emotional Intelligence&quot; a number of other personality qualities come to mind in relation to it. </p>
                        <p>For some people, the term emotional intelligence brings to mind zeal and persistence , or optimism , or strength of character in general. Other people think of social intelligence and pratical intelligence . </p>
                        <p>What are these qualities and how do these qualities relate to emotional intelligence? </p>
                        <h3>What Are These Qualities? </h3>
                        <p>Zeal and persistence , optimism , and strength of character , are all traits. So are social intelligence , practical intelligence , and emotional intelligence . Traits, in this sense, are &quot;thematically coherent collections of features within personality&quot; [1]. For example, persistence involves the theme of &quot;keeping going in a steady fashion under pressures&quot; and involves a number of features that are related to persistence. These thematically related mental features include: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>a motive to attain a given goal 
                            <li>cognitive beliefs that continuing to reach the goal are important and may pay off
                            <li>plans for how to meet the goal, and 
                            <li>self-control to continue toward the goal. 
                        </ol>
                        <p>Traits are usually expressed as tendencies to behave in certain ways (e.g., to persist) across times and situations. </p>
                        <h3>What Does It Mean to Label Something a Trait? </h3>
                        <p>To say a characteristic is a trait is to say that it describes something about how personality functions. For example, someone high in emotional intelligence is likely to be able to reason well with emotional information. Someone high in persistence is likely to be able to continue working at a task longer than others. </p>
                        <p>To return to the opening issue: Some people connect traits like persistence with traits like emotional intelligence, and it is worth exploring that to further clarify the notion of emotional intelligence. To further understand the issue, we must understand the basis for grouping traits together. </p>
                        <p>There is no single "best way" to group traits together. Rather, traits are grouped together for a purpose. The purpose might be to identify desirable traits, or to understand which traits function together, or to understand which traits predict a given outcome. These alternatives are described in more detail in the special section: "How (and Why) Are Traits Grouped Together?" </p>
                        <h3>How (and Why) Are Traits Grouped Together? </h3>
                        <p>Psychologists generally group personality traits together for several reasons. </p>
                        <h4>Evaluative Grouping. </h4>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Description. Traits can be grouped together according to whether they seem desirable or not. Thus, optimism and persistence might be grouped together because they are socially desirable; similarly, neuroticism (e.g., highly emotional) and carelessness might be grouped together because they are relatively socially undesirable. </li>
                          <li>Purpose: This sort of grouping can be used to understand which traits people prefer and why. For example, the positive psychology movement has identified a number of character strengths and values so as to understand more about people's positive attributes. </li>
                          <li>As Applied to Emotional Intelligence: Sometimes, lots of positive attributes are joined together with emotional intelligence because they seem to describe similarly positive things: e.g., self-awareness, diversity tolerance, reality perception, and the like. This tells us that emotional intelligence is generally viewed as a desireable attribute, like many other qualities. However, grouping variables such as optimism, persistence, reality contact, and emotional intelligence should not be confused with concluding that emotional intelligence is the same as those other variables. They are only similar in being considered desirable. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Correlational Grouping </h4>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Description. Two variables may be associated if empirical research indicates that the variables correlate highly together. For example, positive emotionality and sociability are fairly highly correlated, and these two variables are often grouped together as part of a broader variable called &quot;Extraversion&quot; -- a lively, outgoing personality style. </li>
                          <li>Purpose. Variables are grouped together when they correlate highly because they &quot;behave similarly.&quot; That is, as one variable goes up and down, so does the other. This means, pragmatically, that they are often brought about by the same causes, and predict the same outcomes. In this case, pairing the variables makes conceptual sense, and also saves time by placing related variables together. </li>
                          <li>As Applied to Emotional Intelligence : In the study of ability-based EI discussed on this web site, correlational grouping is used to demonstrate that EI abilities cluster together, and can be considered a unitary ability -- emotional intelligence [2]. Other than that, correlational grouping is not generally employed because ability-based EI is a fairly unique variable, and does not have high correlations with other intellectual or emotional traits. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Functional Grouping </h4>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Description. Two variables are often associated if they relate to the same functional area of psychological functioning. For example, pleasant-versus-unpleasant affect and aroused-calm mood are often grouped together because -- even though they are typically uncorrelated with one another -- they both pertain to the emotions system. </li>
                          <li>Purpose: By grouping variables according to the functional areas of psychology that they describe, one can ensure that the important aspects of a functional area of psychology are measured and studied together. </li>
                          <li>As Applied to Emotional Intelligence. In large-scale studies of important outcomes, it may often be useful to sample a variety of traits from personality psychology, in addition to ability-based emotional intelligence. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Predictive Grouping </h4>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Description. Two variables may also become associated if they both help predict the same outcome. For example, say that sensation-seeking (also known as thrill-seeking) and intelligence both predict drug use. If so, the two variables might be studied together programatically, even though they are not correlated and do not describe the same functional areas of personality. </li>
                          <li>Purpose. This approach groups variables together that are of pragmatic importance to predicting specific outcomes. </li>
                          <li>As Applied to Emotional Intelligence. Emotional intelligence might be grouped with other variables, such as positive affect, that together might predict a common outcome, such as good attachments with others. (This is an example, these variables have not yet been studied together). </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2>Why Study Emotional Intelligence Together With Personality Psychology? </h2>
                        <p>There are several reasons to understand emotional intelligence and personality together. Emotional intelligence is a part of human personality, and personality provides the context in which emotional intelligence operates. </p>
                        <p>Emotional intelligence can be considered a mental ability that involves the ability to reason validly with emotional information, and the action of emotions to enhance thought. </p>
                        <p>Personality can be defined as a person's pattern of internal experience and social interaction that arises from the action of that individual's major psychological subsystems. Major psychological subsystems involve emotion, cognition, and the self, among others . ...for more, <a href="http://www.thepersonalitysystem.org">click here </a>. </p>
                        <p>There are several reasons to understand this relationship: </p>
                        <p>1.Understanding "where"and "what" EI is (e.g., a mental ability inside, or, a part of, personality) can help identify the type of data necessary to collect to study the idea. .for more, <a href="http://www.unh.edu/emotional_intelligence/ei%20What%20is%20EI/eiemotint4.htm">click here </a>. </p>
                        <p>2. Placing emotional intelligence in its psychological context allows one to compare and contrast it with different parts of personality: </p>
                        <ul>
						<li>those that are similar
                        <li>those that are related, and,
                        <li>those that are different.
						</li></ul>
                        <p>.for more, <a href="http://www.unh.edu/emotional_intelligence/ei%20What%20is%20EI/eiemotint5.htm">click here </a>. </p>
                        <p>3. If a person's ultimate aim is to understand a target variable - such as aggression or problem behavior - understanding the personality system as a whole can help link EI with other relevant parts of personality for empirical study. </p>
                        <p>4. Understanding EI as a part of the broader personality system also can alert researchers as to what parts of personality may influence EI, increase its effects, or lower them. </p>
                        <p>5. Considerable research exists as to how personality's parts are expressed. Understanding that EI is part of personality indicates a great deal about how it will be expressed. </p>                        <strong>
